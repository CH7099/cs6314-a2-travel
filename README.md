You can run the project by:
1) Opening the console
2) Navigating into the project directory
3) Using php -S localhost:8000 (starts PHP server so that AJAX can actually run)*
4) Entering the following URL in your browser: http://localhost:8000/home.html

*PHP will need to be added to your system PATH environment variable
